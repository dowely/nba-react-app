      The franchise was founded as the Buffalo Braves in 1970 as an expansion team. Led by Hall of
      Famer Bob McAdoo, the Braves reached the NBA playoffs three times during their eight seasons
      in Buffalo. Conflicts with the Canisius Golden Griffins over the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium
      and the sale of the franchise led to their relocation from Buffalo to San Diego, California in
      1978 and subsequent rebranding as the San Diego Clippers, in reference to the sailing ships
      seen in San Diego Bay. The team saw little success on the court and missed the playoffs during
      all six of their years in San Diego. Wikipedia
